## What is this paper addressing? What problem are the authors trying to solve?

This paper presents TIME-LLM, a framework to adapt large language models (LLMs) for general time series forecasting without modifying the pre-trained backbone. The key problems addressed are:

1. Generalizing time series forecasting across diverse domains and tasks, as current methods are often narrowly specialized.
2. Leveraging the few-shot and zero-shot transfer learning capabilities of LLMs for data-efficient forecasting.
3. Harnessing LLMs' reasoning and pattern recognition abilities for precise forecasting.
4. Combining multimodal knowledge from LLMs to enable synergistic forecasting with diverse data types.
5. Providing an accessible solution for time series forecasting by repurposing off-the-shelf LLMs without extensive retraining.

The overarching goal is to unlock the untapped potential of LLMs as versatile and effective time series learners through a reprogramming approach.

## What is the related work in this area? What is the SoA? How does the authors' work differ from these existing works?

**Related Work**:

- **Task-specific Learning**: Conventional approaches like ARIMA, LSTM, TCN, and Transformers [cited] are designed for specific forecasting tasks and trained end-to-end on domain data.
- **In-modality Adaptation**: Time Series Pre-trained Models (TSPTMs) [cited] involve pre-training on time series data and then fine-tuning for specific tasks, similar to NLP and CV.
- **Cross-modality Adaptation**: Some works explore adapting pre-trained models from other modalities like speech (Voice2Series [cited]) or language (LLM4TS [cited], GPT4TS [cited]) for time series tasks through fine-tuning or editing inputs.

**State-of-the-Art (SoA)**:

- For specialized forecasting tasks, models like PatchTST, ETSformer, FEDformer, and Autoformer represent SoA.
- For cross-modal adaptation of LLMs, GPT4TS and LLMTime are recent SoA approaches involving fine-tuning.

**Differences from Existing Works**:

1. TIME-LLM does not require fine-tuning the LLM backbone, keeping it frozen during reprogramming.
2. It reprograms time series data into text prototypes more natural for the LLM, rather than direct input editing.
3. It uses natural language prompts to augment the LLM's reasoning abilities for time series tasks.
4. The authors demonstrate SoA performance across standard, few-shot, and zero-shot forecasting settings without task-specific training.
5. The work provides a general reprogramming paradigm to imbue LLMs with new capabilities beyond their original pre-training.

## Briefly explain their high-level methodology. What are the key intuitions and any assumptions made.

**High-Level Methodology**:

The authors do not perform traditional AutoML for architecture or hyperparameter search. Instead, they investigate reprogramming pre-trained LLMs as follows:

1. **Input Transformation**: Time series data is partitioned into univariate series, normalized, and divided into patches. These patches are embedded and reprogrammed using learned text prototypes to align with the LLM's modality.

2. **Frozen LLM**: A pre-trained LLM like Llama or GPT-2 is used with its parameters frozen. No fine-tuning is performed.

3. **Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP)**: Natural language prompts containing domain knowledge, task instructions, and input statistics are prepended to the reprogrammed patches. This augments the LLM's reasoning ability for the time series task.

4. **Output Projection**: The LLM's output representations are projected to generate time series forecasts.

**Key Intuitions and Assumptions**:

1. Reprogramming the input modality aligns time series data with the LLM's pre-training, enabling its capabilities to be leveraged for forecasting.

2. Natural language prompts provide declarative guidance to direct the LLM's transformations on the reprogrammed input patches.

3. Keeping the LLM backbone frozen allows efficient adaptation without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

4. Combining statistical models, deep learning, and regression-based forecasters through the reprogrammed LLM leads to better overall pattern manipulation capabilities compared to individual model classes.

The core assumption is that aligning time series data with the LLM's modality and providing natural language guidance can effectively activate the LLM's reasoning and few-shot transfer abilities for accurate and data-efficient forecasting across diverse tasks.

## How do they evaluate their approach? What are the baselines they compare to? What evaluation metrics do they use? Are there any key insights behind the performance achieved?

**Evaluation**:

The authors conduct comprehensive evaluations across three main tasks:

1. **Long-term Forecasting**:

   - Datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Electricity, Traffic, ILI
   - Baselines: PatchTST, GPT4TS, DLinear, TimesNet, FEDformer, Autoformer, and others
   - Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

2. **Short-term Forecasting**:

   - Dataset: M4 benchmark
   - Baselines: GPT4TS, TimesNet, PatchTST, N-HiTS, N-BEATS, and others
   - Metrics: Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), Overall Weighted Average (OWA)

3. **Few-shot and Zero-shot Forecasting**:
   - Datasets: Subsets of the above, used in limited data and cross-domain adaptation settings
   - Baselines: GPT4TS, LLMTime, DLinear, PatchTST, TimesNet
   - Metrics: MSE, MAE

**Key Insights**:

1. TIME-LLM consistently outperforms SOTA and specialized baselines across all tasks, achieving up to 12% MSE reduction in long-term forecasting and 8.7% improvement over the second-best in short-term forecasting.

2. The performance gains are more pronounced in few-shot (up to 20% over baselines) and zero-shot (up to 75% over LLMTime) settings, demonstrating the effective knowledge transfer and reasoning capabilities activated by the reprogramming approach.

3. Larger LLM backbones, more text prototypes, and longer input context generally lead to better performance, in line with the scaling laws of pre-trained models.

4. Ablations show that both patch reprogramming and natural language prompts are crucial for aligning the modalities and augmenting the LLM's time series reasoning abilities.

5. The reprogramming approach itself is lightweight and efficient, capped only by the LLM backbone, while outperforming even parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like QLoRA.

The strong performance is attributed to the effective combination of diverse forecasting paradigms through in-context learning in the reprogrammed LLM, leveraging its reasoning capabilities while keeping the backbone frozen for efficiency.
